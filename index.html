# TODOs

* Cargo / crates.io

* Strong static typing

* C memory layout, easy FFI

* Imperative, C-like syntax
    * But expression-oriented & uses lambdas heavily

* Structs with trait based inheritance (no OOP)

* Aimed at systems programming
    * Control over heap vs stack allocation
    
    * No automatic garbage collection

    * Fast

* Native threads, strings stored as UTF-8

* Backed by Mozilla

* Get into Rayon

# An introduction to Rust

&nbsp;

### "Technology from the past come 
### to save the future from itself"

---

# Agenda

1. What is Rust?
    * Rust vs C++
2. Rust's killer features
3. Parallelism in Rust

---

# Origin story

* 2006 - 2010: Mozilla employee side project

--

    * "I have been writing a compiled, concurrent,
safe, systems programming language for the
past four and a half years."

    * "Spare-time kinda thing. Yeah, I got problems."

--

* 2010 - 2015: Mozilla-sponsored community-driven development

    * "Many older languages better than newer ones"

    * "We keep forgetting already-learned lessons"

    * Rust has lost more features than most languages ever gain

--

* May 2015: Stable 1.0 public release

     * Already in production at Dropbox, Chef, NPM, Xero

mozilla employee = Graydon Hoare, who then became BFDL

Initial Graydon presentation: http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf

Graydon steps down for personal reasons in Aug 2013: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lfoaz/graydon_hoare_steps_down_as_technical_lead_on_rust/ and https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-August/005426.html

Rust is explicitly not a language to perform programming research in - it's a better C++. But what makes a better C++ wasn't clear

Older languages such as Mesa (1977), BETA (1975), CLU (1974)

Of course mozilla is a production user too.

Sample of Rust production users: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html

# "Why Oh Why? #1" (from 2010)

* C++ is well past expiration date:

    * Wildly unsafe in almost every way

        * Memory unsafe, no ownership policies, no concurrent control at all, can't even keep const values constant.

    * Heavily burdened with legacy issues

        * Absurd compilation model, weak linkage and module system, nigh impossible to write tools for.

    * Spend more time fighting its weaknesses than seems reasonable.
        * Maybe you've noticed?

???

Original motivation for Rust as described by Graydon to Mozilla employees working on Firefox.

Transcribed from slides at http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf

# "Why Oh Why? #2" (from 2010)

* Most newer languages are unsuitable. One or more of:

    * JVM/CLR or similar tie-in, VM/FFI burden

    * Complex GC + pointer-heavy = poor memory use

    * "Different paradigm" (hard to find talent for, comprehension barrier, unpredictable)

    * "Script language" (few types or static checks)

    * Mostly ignore isolation, interference, concurrency

## A code sample

```rust
fn parse_boggle_board(board_path: &String) -> io::Result<BoggleBoard> {
    use std::io::BufReader;
    use std::io::prelude::*;
    use std::fs::File;

    print!("Parsing board from {}", board_path);
    let board_file = BufReader::new(try!(File::open(board_path)));
    let mut width = None;
    let mut height = None;
    let mut letters = Vec::with_capacity(10000);
    for line_or_err in board_file.lines() {
        let line = line_or_err.unwrap(); // explode if error
        if line.len() == 0 {
            break; // end of file
        }
        for s in line.split(' ').filter(|s| s.len() != 0) {
            if width.is_none() {
                width = Some(s.parse().unwrap());
            } else if height.is_none() {
                height = Some(s.parse().unwrap());
            } else {
                letters.push(s.bytes().nth(0).expect("first char !present"));
            }
        }
    }
    Ok(BoggleBoard::new(width.expect("board width must be specified"),
                        height.expect("board height must be specified"),
                        letters))
}
```

```rust
    fn main() -> i32 {
      let my_homie: String = "Caspar".to_owned();
      println!("{} was here", my_homie);
    }
